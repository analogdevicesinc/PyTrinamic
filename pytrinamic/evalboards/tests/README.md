# Eval Board Integration Tests

The tests do not require hardware.

Requirements:

* Install `pytest` via `pip install pytest`
* Have `pytrinamic` installed from local src ([Python Packaging: installing-from-a-local-src-tree](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-from-a-local-src-tree)) via `python3 -m pip install -e <pytrinamic-repo-path>`

How to run the tests:

* Run `pytest` within this directory. Use `pytest -v` to have more details on what tests did run.
